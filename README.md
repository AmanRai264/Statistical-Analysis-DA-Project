# Statistical Analysis Data Project

## Overview
This project focuses on performing statistical analysis on a dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and various statistical techniques to understand data patterns and relationships.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `train.csv`. It contains multiple features, including numerical and categorical variables. Some key columns include:
- **Age**: Processed to handle missing values and ensure numerical consistency.
- **Pclass, Sex, Fare, Survived**: Used for predictive modeling.
- **Other features**: Various attributes analyzed for insights.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, type conversion, and consistency checks.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis.
- Statistical Techniques: Applying statistical methods to derive insights from the data.
- Machine Learning Model: Implemented Logistic Regression to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.
